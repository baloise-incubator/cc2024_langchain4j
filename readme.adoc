= LLM for engineering questions using langchain4j (optionally on Azure)

== Vision

* Questions about code (preferrably our company repositories) can be answered
** similar to co-pilot
** more specific to our company
** eg 'how to search for a partner?', how to use the partner service, ...

=== ToDo

* ci/cd pipeline for such an application
* how can we offer the service sustainably
* learning, learning
* TDD such an app

=== Done
* explored the https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples/tree/main/other-examples/src/main/java[langchain4j example repository]
* found the https://github.com/langchain4j/langchain4j-examples/blob/main/other-examples/src/main/java/embedding/store/InMemoryEmbeddingStoreExample.java[InMemoryEmbeddingStoreExample] which
** load files/text into the model ("I like football", ...)
** and ask questions "which sport do you like" -> "football"

* watched very good presentation on an RAG use case: https://youtu.be/J-3n7xs98Kc?si=xiSmOOrVC3IcbxEP
