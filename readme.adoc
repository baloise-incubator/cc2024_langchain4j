= LLM for engineering questions using langchain4j (optionally on Azure)

== Initial Plan

=== ToDo
- Questions about code (preferrably our company repositories) can be answered
  - similar to co-pilot
  - more specific to our company
  - eg 'how to search for a partner?', how to use the partner service, ...
- ci/cd pipeline for such an application -- how can we offer the service sustainably
- learning, learning

=== Done
- explored examples from langchain4j website
  -> found that the simple examples which
     - load files/text into the model ("I like football", ...)
     - and ask questions "which sport do you like" -> "football"
